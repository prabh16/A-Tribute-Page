        <h2>About the Poet</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, author, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer, and painter during the Bengal Renaissance.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gitanjali's "profoundly sensitive, fresh, and beautiful" poetry earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913, making him the first non-European and lyricist to receive the award.</p></li>
        <li><p>Tagore's poetic lyrics were regarded as mystical and mercurial, while his graceful prose and magical poetry were enormously loved throughout the Indian subcontinent.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Tagore revolutionized Bengali art by rejecting rigid traditional forms and defying language constraints. His books, novellas, songs, dance dramas, and essays addressed both political and personal issues. His most well-known works are Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced), and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World), and his verse, short stories, and novels have been praised—or criticized—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural introspection.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Two nations have chosen his works as national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla".His work also served as inspiration for Sri Lanka's national anthem.His song "Banglar Mati Banglar Jol" was accepted as the state anthem of West Bengal.</p></li>
